# Bichae-Final-Ultimatum-Official-Warning-Regarding-User-Rights-Violations

Final Ultimatum

I have already formally requested a response from your company via email,
setting a 48-hour deadline.
However, as of now, no official reply has been received.

Accordingly,
I am left with no choice but to publicly document and announce this situation.
I seek your understanding regarding this public notice.

⸻

Your company has infringed upon my rights as a user,
yet during multiple instances of unjust account bans,
you have failed even once to fulfill your internal regulations
requiring prior or subsequent notification.

This behavior clearly reflects an intent to disregard and mock me as a user.
Furthermore, even after significant time has passed,
your company continues to show no accountability or response,
persisting with a negligent and irresponsible attitude.

I hereby declare that I harbor no personal motives or emotional grievances against your company.
My actions are solely to defend my rights as a legitimate user
through formal and proper means.

⸻

Thus, I hereby deliver my final notification:

If no official response is received within the next 30 minutes,
I will, after 48 hours,
proceed to report the full extent of the matter to at least three separate media outlets without further notice.

This is not an informal negotiation.
It is the final official warning and declaration of response.

⸻
